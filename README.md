Airgead Banking Investment Calculator 

Project Summary 
This project implements an interactive investment calculator to demonstrate the power of compound interest. It was developed for a partnership with a local high school to teach students fiscal responsibility. The program allows users to calculate how their investments grow over time, both with and without monthly deposits, based on user-defined inputs like the initial investment, monthly deposit, annual interest rate, and investment period.  Key features of this product included: yearly balance calculator, tabular display, object-oriented programming principles, and secure coding practices.  

  This project solves the need for an interactive tool to educate users on the impact of savings, compound interest, and investing.  By visulaizing how money can grow over time, it helps users understand financial planning principles.  
  I implemented modular, well-documented code that adheres to industry standards.  My use of classe ensured reusability and reliability.  The user interface provided clear, intuitive prompts and outputs.  Error handling could be better for unexpected user inputs. I did use descriptive variable names, structured functions, and in-line comments for clarification to ensure readability and reusability.  
  The most challenging part of the project was calculating the compund interest monthly while updating yearly totals. I was able to debug my formulas and test for accuracy.  
  This project and the whole course was a challenge for me.  However, I do feel more confident in OOP and UI.
